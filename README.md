## About me
> Platform Engineer with hands-on experience in Kubernetes, Docker containers, and GitOps workflows using FluxCD.

I build and maintain CI/CD pipelines that help teams deploy code smoothly and reliably, including proper linting of codebase. I work extensively with Terraform and Ansible to manage infrastructure and write bash and python scripts to automate repetitive tasks and make systems more efficient.

I'm curious about discovering new tools on GitHub and staying up to date with emerging CNCF projects that can solve real problems. I'm comfortable working in Linux environments and enjoy using open-source technologies to build better solutions. When things break (and they do), I dig in to figure out what went wrong and how to prevent it next time. I also like helping teammates learn new technologies and creating a supportive environment where everyone can grow.
